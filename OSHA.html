<p>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) (<a href="/coronavirus/safework" title="Protecting Workers: Guidance on Mitigating and Preventing the Spread of COVID-19 in the Workplace">Guidance</a>) has issued workplace guidance to help employers protect all workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. Employers should assess worker exposure to hazards and risks and implement infection prevention measures, in accordance with CDC and OSHA guidance, to reasonably address them, consistent with <a href="https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/standards" title="COVID-19 Regulations">OSHA Standards</a>. Such measures could include providing paid time off for workers to get vaccinated; encouraging workers to be vaccinated; having a system for workers to report if they are experiencing symptoms or test positive for COVID-19; use of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html#anchor_1604966572663" title="Types of Masks">face coverings by workers</a>; improving ventilation; training workers on COVID-19 policies and procedures; and physical distancing for workers in communal work areas.</p>

<p>Employers subject to <a href="/coronavirus/standards" title="COVID-19 Regulations">OSHA's PPE standards</a> must provide and require the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) when needed. Job hazard assessments for COVID-19 (<a href="/safety-management/hazard-Identification" title="Hazard Identification and Assessment">general job hazard assessment</a>) must be conducted to determine the appropriate type and level of PPE required.</p>

<p>No. Employers must not use surgical masks or cloth face coverings for construction work when respirators are required to protect the wearer. For additional information about respirator requirements in the construction industry, see the <a href="#construction" title="Construction">Construction FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>In general, employers should always rely on a hierarchy of controls that first includes efforts to eliminate or substitute out workplace hazards and then uses engineering controls (e.g., ventilation, wet methods), administrative controls (e.g., written procedures, modification of task duration), and safe work practices to prevent worker exposures to respiratory hazards, before relying on personal protective equipment, such as respirators.</p>

<p>No. Medical masks, including surgical masks, are routinely worn by healthcare workers throughout the day as part of their personal protective equipment (PPE) ensembles and do not compromise their oxygen levels or cause carbon dioxide buildup. They are designed to be breathed through and can protect against respiratory droplets, which are typically much larger than tiny carbon dioxide molecules. Consequently, most carbon dioxide molecules will either go through the mask or escape along the mask's loose-fitting perimeter. Some carbon dioxide might collect between the mask and the wearer's face, but not at unsafe levels.</p>

<p>Like medical masks, cloth face coverings are loose-fitting with no seal and are designed to be breathed through. In addition, workers may easily remove their medical masks or cloth face coverings periodically (and when not in close proximity with others) to eliminate any negligible build-up of carbon dioxide that might occur. Cloth face coverings and medical masks can help prevent the spread of potentially infectious respiratory droplets from the wearer to their co-workers, including when the wearer has COVID-19 and does not know it.</p>

<p>Some people have mistakenly claimed that OSHA standards (e.g., the Respiratory Protection standard, <a href="/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134" title="29 CFR 1910.134">29 CFR 1910.134</a>; the Permit-Required Confined Space standard <a href="/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.146" title="29 CFR 1910.146">29 CFR 1910.146</a>; and the Air Contaminants standard, <a href="/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.1000" title="29 CFR 1910.1000">29 CFR 1910.1000</a>) apply to the issue of oxygen or carbon dioxide levels resulting from the use of medical masks or cloth face coverings in work settings with normal ambient air (e.g. healthcare settings, offices, retail settings, construction). These standards do not apply to the wearing of medical masks or cloth face coverings in work settings with normal ambient air. These standards would only apply to work settings where there are known or suspected sources of chemicals (e.g., manufacturing facilities) or workers are required to enter a potentially dangerous location (e.g., a large tank or vessel).</p>

<div aria-labelledby="heading-respirator" class="panel-collapse collapse" id="collapse-respirator" role="tabpanel">
<div class="panel-body">
<p>Yes, an N95 respirator is effective in protecting workers from the virus that causes COVID-19. "N95" refers to a class of respirator filter that removes at least 95% of very small (0.3 micron) particles from the air. Some people have mistakenly claimed that since the virus that causes COVID-19 is approximately 0.1 microns in size, wearing an N95 respirator will not protect against such a small virus. That mistaken claim appears to result from a misunderstanding of how respirators work.</p>

<p>When an infected person expels the virus into the air by activities like talking, coughing, or sneezing, the airborne particles are composed of more than just the virus. The virus is part of larger particles that are made up of water and other materials such as mucus. These larger particles are easily trapped and filtered out by N95 respirators because they are too big to pass through the filter. This is called mechanical filtration. But mechanical filtration is just one of the ways that respirator filters keep particles from passing through the filter. An electrostatic charge also attracts particles to fibers in the filter, where the particles become stuck. In addition, the smallest particles constantly move around (called "Brownian motion"), and are very likely to hit a filter fiber and stick to it.</p>

<p>The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) tests respirators using particles that simulate a 0.3 micron diameter because this size particle is most likely to pass through the filter. If worn correctly, the N95 respirator will filter out at least 95% of particles this size. An N95 respirator is <strong><em>more</em></strong> effective at filtering particles that are smaller or larger than 0.3 microns in size.</p>

<p>The N95 respirator filter, as is true for other NIOSH-approved respirators, is very effective at protecting people from the virus causing COVID-19. However, it is important for employers and workers to remember that the respirator only provides the expected protection when used correctly. Respirators, when required, must be used as part of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that meets the requirements of <a href="/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134" title="29 CFR 1910.134">29 CFR 1910.134</a> including requirements for medical evaluations, training, and fit testing. The <a href="/coronavirus/ets" title="COVID-19 Healthcare ETS">Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) for Healthcare</a> also includes requirements for respiratory protection and a <a href="/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.504" title="1910.504 - Mini Respiratory Protection Program">Mini Respiratory Protection Program</a>. The Mini Respiratory Protection Program applies to specific circumstances specified under the ETS, generally when workers are not exposed to suspected or confirmed sources of COVID-19 but where respirator use could offer enhanced worker protection.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The basics of how SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, spreads and the importance of physical distancing (including remote work), ventilation, vaccination, use of face coverings, and hand hygiene;</li>
	<li>Workplace policies and procedures implemented to protect workers from COVID-19 hazards;</li>

<p>Some OSHA standards require employers to provide specific training to workers.

<p>DOL and OSHA, as well as other federal agencies, are working diligently to encourage COVID-19 vaccinations. OSHA does not wish to have any appearance of discouraging workers from receiving COVID-19 vaccination, and also does not wish to disincentivize employers' vaccination efforts. As a result, OSHA will not enforce 29 CFR 1904's recording requirements to require any employers to record worker side effects from COVID-19 vaccination at least through May 2022. We will reevaluate the agency’s position at that time to determine the best course of action moving forward.</p>
